      Our Story
    </h3>

      <p>
        Adam and Heather's love story began unexpectedly on April 27th,
        2019, at a wine festival they both attended last-minute after
        some spaces became free. Despite not planning to be there, they
        crossed paths and hit it off instantly. When COVID-19 hit, they
        were separated physically but stayed connected through daily
        Skype calls. In 2021, Heather moved in with Adam and his parents
        for what was meant to be a short stay during lockdown, but it
        turned into over a year.

      <h4 class="font-serif text-2xl font-medium">
        Dec 16th, 2023, she Said Yes!
      </h4>
      <p>
        After renovating their house, which they bought together the
        year before, Adam surprised Heather with a proposal on December
        16th, 2023, at Surprise View in the Lake District. Overlooking
        the stunning scenery, he asked her to be his partner for life,
        and she accepted. Their journey, from a chance meeting at a wine
        festival to a heartfelt proposal amidst nature's beauty, is a
        testament to the strength of their love and commitment through
        life's unpredictable twists and turns.
